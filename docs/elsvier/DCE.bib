  abstract = {The increasing proportion of elderly in European populations has prompted debate about where and how they will reside. Our main hypothesis is that when moving in this phase of life the most common move would be one from a suburban location in owneroccupation to a more central location. This would be in line with the popular belief that older people, when they retire or when the children have moved out, want to take part in the culture of city living, such as concerts, theatres and museums in addition to enjoying a more convenient type of housing. This, we argue, is the assumed residential pattern during the third age and a possible part of a mobility cycle as described by Rossi (Why families move: a study in the social psychology of urban residential mobility. The Free Press, Glencoe, 1955). The aim of this study was to examine the local geographical mobility and tenure of older people. The analysis was made using a register database, Geoswede, comprising the total Swedish population. Moves of the cohorts born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were followed between 2001 and 2006. Using five distances to the municipal population core, a centralised mobility pattern could be observed. The two older cohorts made such moves, whereas the majority of the youngest cohort moved to peripheral destinations. From analysis of three case municipalities, it was shown that movers from owner-occupation in the cohort born in the 1940s moved within owner-occupation to a greater extent and made short distance moves. This type of knowledge will have an impact on planning issues.},

Mobility patterns of those born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s are analysed to identify characteristics of stayers and movers, and to determine to what extent the elderly move to rental and tenant cooperative apartments. The analysis is cross-sectional using a register database comprising the Swedish population. Moves were followed between 2001 and 2006. The majority remained in their current dwelling but almost one-quarter moved. Of those, a smaller number moved from owneroccupied housing to a tenant co-operative or rental apartment.},

With a growing number of people living well into their 80s and maintaining active lives, the transportation system will have to start focussing more closely on understanding their mobility and accessibility needs, so as to ensure that specific requirements of this large segment are not being ignored through the promotion of traditional {\^O}solutions{\~O} and historical assumptions. This paper takes a close look at the evidence on the mobility needs and travel patterns of individuals over 64, distinguishing between the ``young'' elderly (aged 65--75 years) and the ``old'' elderly (over 75 years). This distinction is particularly useful in recognising the threshold of health change that impacts in a non-marginal way on mobility needs. This distinction also focuses transport planning and policy on a commitment to understanding the different needs of these sub-groups of the population, identifying services and facilities that better cater for these groups. We review the evidence, in particular, on the mobility characteristics of the over 75 years age group, including how they secure support through migration and settlement patterns. We use the empirical evidence from a number of western nations to identify the role of conventional and specialised public transport as an alternative to the automobile in meeting mobility and accessibility needs.},

The preferences expressed were used as dependent variables in logistic regressions to determine to what extent the housing preferences of older people are linked to age, gender, socio-economic status and type of geographical area. The results demonstrated a close link between neighbourhood characteristics and housing preferences. Owning the dwelling, having a garden and access to nature were stressed as important by individuals living in non-metropolitan middle-class areas and in suburban elite areas. The youngest cohort expressed similar preferences. Older age groups instead stressed the importance of an elevator, single-storey housing and a good design for independent living; preferences that have similarities to those expressed by individuals living in large cities and smaller urban centres where such housing is more readily available.},

  abstract = {Generally, people spend most of their time indoors, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the amount of time people spent at home, owing to the widespread adoption of remote work. Consequently, there has been a heightened interest in indoor comfort, including thermal, visual, and acoustic comfort and indoor air quality. This interest has prompted a need to understand the economic value of each aspect of indoor comfort. To address this, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was performed to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for advanced technological solutions that provide greater comfort than basic solutions in residential housing. The research showed a significant WTP for all aspects of comfort, with the greatest appreciation for thermal comfort. Additionally, the WTP for each aspect of comfort was greater than the additional costs required to implement advanced technological solutions to enable the desired comfort. The findings demonstrated that the sample population, mostly comprising people under the age of forty, was highly sensitive to comfort considerations and the related benefits derived from energy-efficient solutions. Specifically, comparing the WTP of the different aspect of comfort and the total one identified, the following relative importance was found: 51 \% for thermal comfort (WTP = 377.94 EUR/m2); 22 \% for visual comfort (WTP = 166.83 EUR/m2); 16 \% for acoustic comfort (WTP = 119.60 EUR/m2) and 11 \% for indoor air quality (WTP = 79.21 EUR/m2). These motivations can guide future decision-making and designers in the building market.},

On the one hand, facing the lack of specialist housing for the elderly, older people are incentivised to `age in place'; on the other, to move to smaller homes to free-up family housing, reducing pressure on housing supply. This `downsizing' discourse is presented as a `win-win' situation which benefits older people and the rest of society. However, a survey and interviews conducted with over 55 s in England reveals more nuanced patterns of residential moves, behaviours and aspirations than suggested by `downsizing'. Only a minority of older households choose to downsize. This paper looks into this mismatch between observed housing choices and the construction of downsizing as a policy goal. It suggests that theoretically speaking, the very notion of downsizing is problematic and difficult to define and is an oversimplistic concept which in reality applies to a heterogeneous group of people.},

The estimates are derived from a choice experiment funded by the Utah Department of Transportation and Utah Transit Authority---an experiment based upon large samples of both homeowners and renters who participated in a larger, statewide transportation study. The choice experiment and transportation study allow us to control for a rich set of household-level demographic and lifestyle characteristics, which in turn permits identification of a host of factors contributing to heterogeneity in residential preferences. We leverage a percentage-change housing cost attribute included in the experiment to obtain measures of marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for the various residential attributes and attribute levels in our study. Our method of converting the percentage-change cost attribute to dollar-denominated MWTP results in theoretically plausible estimates of a household's MWTP. We find that preferences for residential amenities differ across homeowners and renters with respect to intensity rather than direction---homeowners are generally willing to pay more for these amenities, in some cases up to seven times more. Our quantitative estimates of these preferences and the extent to which we control for heterogeneity across households provide urban and regional planners with precise monetary welfare measures for a sizable majority of the region's residents.},

But, to the extent that housing quality and neighbourhood quality are inter-twined it is difficult to disentangle the extent to which households are more focused on one or another of these two components of the choice process. This paper uses both cross-tabulations of the neighbourhood choices, and logit models of the actual choices, to examine the relative roles of neighbourhoods and houses in the choice process. The research is focused on the question of the extent to which households trade up in house quality, or neighbourhood quality or both, as outcomes of residential mobility. The research measures neighbourhood quality in both socio-economic and environmental dimensions. The study shows that many households not only move up in housing quality, but quite consistently also make gains in neighbourhood quality, often independently of gains in housing quality. Not surprisingly, the largest gains in neighbourhood quality are related to households who make the city/suburban transition in their housing moves. The research adds another dimension to the growing and extensive literature on neighbourhoods and their role in residential choice.},

The aim of this study was to examine the association between access to green space and mental health among adult twin pairs. Methods We used a multilevel random intercept model of same-sex twin pairs (4338 individuals) from the community-based University of Washington Twin Registry to analyse the association between access to green space, as measured by the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and self-reported depression, stress, and anxiety. The main parameter of interest was the within-pair effect for identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins because it was not subject to confounding by genetic or shared childhood environment factors. Models were adjusted for income, physical activity, neighbourhood deprivation and population density. Results When treating twins as individuals and not as members of a twin pair, green space was significantly inversely associated with each mental health outcome. The association with depression remained significant in the within-pair MZ univariate and adjusted models; however, there was no within-pair MZ effect for stress or anxiety among the models adjusted for income and physical activity. Conclusions These results suggest that greater access to green space is associated with less depression, but provide less evidence for effects on stress or anxiety. Understanding the mechanisms linking neighbourhood characteristics to mental health has important public health implications. Future studies should combine twin designs and longitudinal data to strengthen causal inference.},

For the purpose of developing healthy urban neighbourhoods, this raises the question how to take scientific evidence about these health benefits into account. Accessibility metrics that are well substantiated by empirical evidence are needed. This paper reviews the quantitative and qualitative aspects relevant for accessibility metrics and empirical studies addressing these aspects in relation to health. Studies comparing different types of green space indicators suggest that cumulative opportunities indicators are more consistently positively related to health than residential proximity ones. In contrast to residential proximity indicators, cumulative opportunities indicators take all the green space within a certain distance into account. Comparing results across studies proved to be hard. Green space accessibility was measured in a variety of ways and the green space indicator that was chosen was often not problematized. We feel that it is time for a more function-oriented approach. How precisely does contact with nature impact health and what type and qualities are relevant in this regard? We think this will lead to a new generation of more evidence-based accessibility metrics that will help to advance the field.},

Women who had made the decision to relocate on their own showed evidence of better psychosocial well-being at the time of the move. One-quarter of the sample chose to move to provide care to another person.

The package is faster than other similar packages such as mlogit, gmnl, mixl, and apollo, and it supports utility models specified with ``preference space'' or ``willingness-to-pay (WTP) space'' parameterizations, allowing for the direct estimation of marginal WTP. The typical procedure of computing WTP post-estimation using a preference space model can lead to unreasonable distributions of WTP across the population in mixed logit models. The paper provides a discussion of some of the implications of each utility parameterization for WTP estimates. It also highlights some of the design features that enable logitr's performant estimation speed and includes a benchmarking exercise with similar packages. Finally, the paper highlights additional features that are designed specifically for WTP space models, including a consistent user interface for specifying models in either space and a parallelized multi-start optimization loop, which is particularly useful for searching the solution space for different local minima when estimating models with non-convex log-likelihood functions.},

  author = {Hildebrand, Eric D},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {The current lack of a detailed description of elderly travel characteristics and behaviours, particularly one that examines the issue at a level involving activity engagement, was a deficiency addressed by this research. Using data from the 1994/95 Portland, Oregon, Household Activity and Stated Preference Survey a simplified activity-based travel model for the elderly was developed and validated. The modelling framework makes use of lifestyle groups which are delineated through advance analyses. The final cluster solution chosen to provide a categorical basis for the modelling framework identified six distinct lifestyle groups based on sociodemographic variables. The clusters were subjectively labelled Workers, Mobile Widows, Granny Flats, Mobility Impaired, Affluent Males, and Disabled Drivers. The clusters were found to have statistically significant differences in travel behaviour and activity engagement patterns. These findings are useful to policy-makers who attempt to balance the mobility needs of the elderly with the prospect for stricter driving license policies in response to traffic safety concerns. The model framework successfully replicated all facets of the base data set used for its development. Using a sequential process, the micro-simulation model employs a bottom-up approach by stochastically developing daily activity itineraries for individuals which are subsequently assembled into trip tours. Elements of travel behaviour synthesized for individuals being modelled included total daily activities (with and without travel), activities engaged in by class (with and without travel), total daily trip tours, and mode splits. The research has shown that a categorical approach using lifestyle groups with unique activity and travel characteristics can be successfully combined within an activity-based framework. Although this approach was applied specifically to the elderly, it can be extended to other heterogeneous groups including the population as a whole. Furthermore, the study has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the varied lifestyles, activity patterns, and subsequent travel behaviour and needs of the elderly.},

Two commonly used elicitation methods for this purpose are discrete choice experiments (DCE) and case 2 best-worst scaling (BWS). These methods differ in terms of their cognitive burden, which is especially relevant when eliciting preferences among older people. Using a randomised experiment with respondents from an online panel, this paper examines the cognitive burden associated with colour-coded and level overlapped DCE, colour-coded BWS, and `standard' BWS choice tasks in a complex health state valuation setting. Our sample included 469 individuals aged 65 and above. Based on both revealed and stated cognitive burden, we found that the DCE tasks were less cognitively burdensome than case 2 BWS. Colour coding case 2 BWS cannot be recommended as its effect on cognitive burden was less clear and the colour coding lead to undesired choice heuristics. Our results have implications for future health state valuations of complex quality of life instruments and at least serve as an example of assessing cognitive burden associated with different types of choice experiments.},

Caregiving can have a profound impact on the health and wellbeing of carers. Ignoring these spillovers in economic evaluations risks labelling interventions mistakenly as cost-effective, at the expense of informal caregivers. Objective{\enspace} This paper investigates willingness-to-accept (WTA) values for an hour of informal care, corrected for positive and negative impacts of informal care, to facilitate the inclusion of informal care hours on the cost side of economic evaluations without double-counting spillover effects. Methods{\enspace} A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands (n\,=\,552) in September 2011. An experimental design minimizing the D-error was used to construct choice sets with two unlabelled alternatives with the attributes `hours caregiving', `monetary compensation for caregiving' and seven impacts of caregiving. To operationalize the random utility model, we used a panel mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) parameter model. For calculation of WTA, we used both population-level parameters and individual-level parameters. Results{\enspace} The mean WTA for an additional hour of informal care, corrected for positive and negative impacts of informal care, was {\texteuro}14.57. The signs of the coefficients were all in the expected directions. Conclusions{\enspace} This study reports a preference-based monetary value for informal care, corrected for other impacts. This valuation facilitates the inclusion of informal care hours on the cost side in economic evaluations without double-counting any spillover effects included on the effects side.},

To fill this gap, this study utilizes discrete choice experiments to thoroughly explore young users' preferences and willingness to pay for a circular business model (CBM) in affordable housing by considering Dutch and Taiwanese cultural contexts. The analyses highlight the four key attributes that an acceptable CBM for young users in affordable housing should possess: the incorporation of a certain proportion of reused materials, provision of green facilities, availability of furniture services, and effective energy-saving and waste management. Furthermore, young users are willing to allocate 2.5--5\% of their monthly income to support the implementation of CBM, which is beneficial for the adoption of CBM in ongoing affordable housing projects worldwide. The attribute preferences of young users in Taiwan and the Netherlands differ due to varying socio-economic characteristics, sustainability attitudes, and distinct cultural patterns within both societies. Consequently, this paper offers recommendations for governments to expedite the development of CAH.},

The spatial planning of UGS generally asks a trade-off between optimizing land-use and accessibility characteristics which may differ between housing types. In this paper, we use a stated choice experiment to estimate residential location preferences related to neighborhood land-use, UGS and accessibility characteristics in the framework of a land-use model. A national sample of 394 Dutch homeowners participated in the experiments and mixed logit models were estimated by housing type distinguishing detached, row houses and apartments. The estimation results show that trade-offs made between a green neighborhood and accessibility to urban amenities tend to differ between the housing types. The estimates are used as parameters in a housing land-use allocation model. An application of the model to a residential area development problem shows that creating green buffers along road infrastructure is the most beneficial way of allocating UGS considering the housing value for residents. The application further shows that apartments benefit more strongly from UGS in the neighborhood than from high accessibility of urban amenities compared to detached and row houses. Finally, we find that the optimal spatial allocation of UGS depends on whether maximizing housing market-value or residents' utility is the prime objective.},

The interviews were analyzed by using conventional qualitative content analyses. Results: Reasoning about relocation or aging in place in very old age is a complex and ambivalent matter. A variety of reflections, emotions, and behaviors for and against a move are revealed. Reasons to move reflect the urge to maintain independence, to stay in control, and to avoid loneliness. This is mainly expressed reactively. Reasons not to move reflect a strong attachment to the home and neighborhood. Moreover, reasons not to move reflect practical aspect such as economy and strain, as well as fear of losing continuity of habits and routines. Implications: There is a need for society to develop counseling systems to meet very old people's ambivalence and practical considerations to move or not to move. Thus, the ambivalence to stay put or to relocate needs to be further explored from an applied perspective by also taking nonmovers into account.},

However, understanding this is highly relevant for policymakers to understand the impacts of their transport decisions. These dimensions include the distribution of mobility and accessibility levels over particular areas or for specific population groups, as well as how this may affect various social outcomes, including their levels of participation, social inclusion and community cohesion. In response, we propose a method to assess the socially relevant accessibility impacts (SRAIs) of policies in some of these key dimensions. The method combines the use of underlying ethics principles, more specifically the theories of egalitarianism and sufficientarianism, in combination with accessibility-based analysis and the Lorenz curve and Gini index. We then demonstrate the method in a case study example. Our suggestion is that policymakers can use these ethical perspectives to determine the equity of their policies decisions and to set minimum standards for local transport delivery. This will help them to become more confident in the development and adoption of new decision frameworks that promote accessibility over mobility and which also disaggregate the costs and benefits of transport policies over particular areas or for specific under-served population groups.},

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a quantitative technique for eliciting preferences that can be used in the absence of revealed preference data. The method involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios, goods or services. Each alternative is described by several attributes and the responses are used to determine whether preferences are significantly influenced by the attributes and also their relative importance. DCEs are widely used in high-income contexts and are increasingly being applied in low- and middle-income countries to consider a range of policy concerns. This paper aims to provide an introduction to DCEs for policy-makers and researchers with little knowledge of the technique. We outline the stages involved in undertaking a DCE, with an emphasis on the design considerations applicable in a low-income setting.},

Practical estimation of a parametric mixing family can be carried out by Maximum Simulated Likelihood Estimation or Method of Simulated Moments, and easily computed instruments are provided that make the latter procedure fairly efficient. The adequacy of a mixing specification can be tested simply as an omitted variable test with appropriately defined artificial variables.

This paper provides insights on whether loss aversion, in relation to the locational attributes of housing alternatives, affects the preference for alternative housing choices of older people.

The framework is applied in a discrete choice model based on a stated choice experiment with 440 Dutch home owners in the age group of 65 - 75\,years. We find clearly that the current living situation (reference) affects the housing choice behaviour. Among other things, we find a general aversion to changing the type of location for almost all possible moves between city, suburban and town. The results have clear implications for ageing-in-place policies which are currently being developed in many countries.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the associations between the accessibility, greenness, size, and type (active vs. passive) of public open spaces (POS) and clinical risk markers for cardiometabolic diseases and whether such associations could be explained (mediated) by physical activity and psychological well-being. Adult participants (n = 3754) provided clinical, self-reported, and residential location data. Cardiometabolic risk was defined as the sum of six anthropometric and biochemical risk markers. POS accessibility was defined as the number and proportion of POS within a 1000-m road distance from participants' residences. Greenness, size and type were respectively defined as the median Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, median size, and proportion of POS with a sporting land use for all accessible POS. Physical activity and psychological well-being were self-reported. Associations were tested using Poisson regression models accounting for spatial clustering of observations and participants' age, gender, education, income and area-level socioeconomic disadvantage. The number and proportion of POS were not found to be statistically significantly related to cardiometabolic health; however, greenness, size, and type (active) of available POS were inversely related to cardiometabolic risk. The association between POS and cardiometabolic health was partially mediated by physical activity. Psychological well-being was not implicated in the associations tested. These results suggest that the characteristics, not the number or proportion, of locally accessible POS are related to cardiometabolic health and, to some degree, physical activity. Maintaining or improving the quality of locally available POS might be a more effective urban design strategy to support cardiometabolic health than efforts to increase the accessibility of POS.},

It also undertakes a city-wide equity analysis of Perth and compares this with a published analysis for Melbourne. Overall the public transport distribution of the three socially disadvantaged groups was identified to be less equitable when compared to the population as a whole. The elderly had the most inequitable distribution of population relative to other cohorts. Perth's population exhibits a 0.52 Gini coefficient suggesting a relatively unequal spatial distribution of services to the population. However, this is much better than Melbourne (at 0.68). Results imply that 70\% of Perth's population have only 33\% of services supplied, whilst in Melbourne this figure was 19\%. Policy implications and areas for future research in this field were identified.},

Results suggest that late-midlife workers and retirees expect to age in place; expectations to live in highly supportive environments are uniformly low. Older, nonmetropolitan respondents with less education and more years in their homes express the strongest expectations that they will age in place. Those people who rent their homes, have weaker ties to their communities, and have more symptoms of depression tend to foresee a move in the future. However, physical health of respondents and their spouses do not predict future housing expectations. Prior expectations about aging in place, residential history, and life-course changes in marriage and retirement predict actual moves within the next two years, with differing patterns for men and women.},

  abstract = {Past research indicates that for older individuals, transitioning to a home environment better suited to their needs reduces physical, psychological, and social risks, and may even impact the rate of institutionalization. Tenants, compared to homeowners, are subject to different conditions that influence their decisions to relocate, which can either encourage or inhibit them in their pursuit of environmental proactivity. This study investigates whether tenants make relocation decisions based on different factors than do owners. For this purpose, hypothetical relocation decisions are made under the influence of certain ownership constellations. The dataset consists of 264 participants. They were asked about home ownership and then presented with housing vignettes (factorial survey) to indicate how likely they would be to move to a new apartment. The data were analyzed using group comparisons and zero-inflated models. Tenants favor new apartments if their current dwelling is larger than the new one, and if they haven't lived in their current home for a long time. In contrast, owners prefer the new apartment to have a central location. Both groups consider rent, proximity to kin, and a senior-friendly bathroom as important for the new apartment, with rent being more important to tenants than to those who are currently owners. In both groups, we identified predictors that can be interpreted as barriers to environmental proactivity. The results add to the large body of literature on social inequality in old age.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study illuminates the concept of ``aging in place'' in terms of functional, symbolic, and emotional attachments and meanings of homes, neighbourhoods, and communities. It investigates how older people understand the meaning of ``aging in place,'' a term widely used in aging policy and research but underexplored with older people themselves. Design and Methods: Older people (n = 121), ranging in age from 56 to 92 years, participated in focus groups and interviews in 2 case study communities of similar size in Aotearoa New Zealand, both with high ratings on deprivation indices. The question, ``What is the ideal place to grow older?'' was explored, including reflections on aging in place. Thematic and narrative analyses on the meaning of aging in place are presented in this paper. Results: Older people want choices about where and how they age in place. ``Aging in place'' was seen as an advantage in terms of a sense of attachment or connection and feelings of security and familiarity in relation to both homes and communities. Aging in place related to a sense of identity both through independence and autonomy and through caring relationships and roles in the places people live. Implications: Aging in place operates in multiple interacting ways, which need to be taken into account in both policy and research. The meanings of aging in place for older people have pragmatic implications beyond internal ``feel good'' aspects and operate interactively far beyond the ``home'' or housing.},

  abstract = {Urban transportation systems involve thousands of individuals making choices between routes with multiple modes and transfers. For transportation system simulations to produce realistic results, modelers need to incorporate these users and their choices. Choice-based conjoint surveys provide an attractive solution for obtaining flexible utility models that can be used to predict choices for a wide variety of trips. In this study, we demonstrate an example using conjoint survey data of commuter mode choice in the Washington, D.C. metro area (N = 1651). We sample commuters who primarily drive and those that take transit. We examine preferences for different types of multimodal trips, including those with intramodal and intermodel transfers. We find that trips involving a bus transfer are the least preferred while both drivers and transit users both value metro similarly to driving. We also find that walking during transit trips is an important barrier, with the travel time penalty for walking being 60\% higher than that of time in a vehicle. Our findings highlight the significance of accounting for differences in modal transfer types in transportation system simulations. Reducing arrival time uncertainty was not a significant factor in commuter mode choice, and commuters' value of time was similar across all vehicle types, suggesting that increasing the relative speed of transit modes may only have a marginal effect on commuter substitution away from personal vehicles.},

  abstract = {Background: While housing and neighborhood features have the potential to impact opportunities for active aging, there is a lack of knowledge related to how older people reason regarding their housing situation and how housing and fulfillment of relocation are associated with active and healthy aging. Objective: The objectives of Prospective RELOC-AGE are to study housing choices and relocation and explore effects on active and healthy aging among men and women aged 55 years and older in Sweden considering relocation. Methods: The estimated sample (2800) will include people aged 55 years and older being listed for relocation at either of two housing companies: a local public housing company in Southern Sweden and a national condominium provider. Prospective RELOC-AGE has a 2-level longitudinal mixed methods design and includes quantitative surveys (implemented by a professional survey company) and a telephone interview for baseline data collection in 2021, with follow-ups with the same procedures in 2022 and 2023. The survey and interviews include questions related to present housing and neighborhood, relocation plans and expectations, a range of perspectives on active and healthy aging, and demographics. Linking to national registers will provide additional data on home help and health care use, objective housing, and neighborhood characteristics. To explore what housing attributes older adults considering relocation find important and to what extent when making their decisions on housing, we will develop a discrete choice experiment to be implemented with a subsample of participants. Further, a grounded theory approach will be applied to collect in-depth interview data from participants who have moved to another dwelling, within 6 months of the move. A follow-up interview 12 months later will focus on participants' deepened experience over time in terms of fulfilled expectations and relocation experiences. Results: As of submission of this protocol (June 2021), recruitment has commenced with approximately 960 respondents to the survey and ongoing telephone interviews. We anticipate recruitment and data collection based on surveys and interviews to continue during 2021. Conclusions: Prospective RELOC-AGE has the capacity to generate new policy-relevant knowledge on associations of housing, relocation, and active and healthy aging. Such knowledge is relevant for the development of proactive approaches to housing in old age on the individual, group, and societal levels.},
