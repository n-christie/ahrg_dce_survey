  abstract = {The increasing proportion of elderly in European populations has prompted debate about where and how they will reside. Our main hypothesis is that when moving in this phase of life the most common move would be one from a suburban location in owneroccupation to a more central location. This would be in line with the popular belief that older people, when they retire or when the children have moved out, want to take part in the culture of city living, such as concerts, theatres and museums in addition to enjoying a more convenient type of housing. This, we argue, is the assumed residential pattern during the third age and a possible part of a mobility cycle as described by Rossi (Why families move: a study in the social psychology of urban residential mobility. The Free Press, Glencoe, 1955). The aim of this study was to examine the local geographical mobility and tenure of older people. The analysis was made using a register database, Geoswede, comprising the total Swedish population. Moves of the cohorts born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were followed between 2001 and 2006. Using five distances to the municipal population core, a centralised mobility pattern could be observed. The two older cohorts made such moves, whereas the majority of the youngest cohort moved to peripheral destinations. From analysis of three case municipalities, it was shown that movers from owner-occupation in the cohort born in the 1940s moved within owner-occupation to a greater extent and made short distance moves. This type of knowledge will have an impact on planning issues.},

  abstract = {Populations of post-industrial nations are aging. With a growing number of people living well into their 80s and maintaining active lives, the transportation system will have to start focussing more closely on understanding their mobility and accessibility needs, so as to ensure that specific requirements of this large segment are not being ignored through the promotion of traditional {\^O}solutions{\~O} and historical assumptions. This paper takes a close look at the evidence on the mobility needs and travel patterns of individuals over 64, distinguishing between the ``young'' elderly (aged 65--75 years) and the ``old'' elderly (over 75 years). This distinction is particularly useful in recognising the threshold of health change that impacts in a non-marginal way on mobility needs. This distinction also focuses transport planning and policy on a commitment to understanding the different needs of these sub-groups of the population, identifying services and facilities that better cater for these groups. We review the evidence, in particular, on the mobility characteristics of the over 75 years age group, including how they secure support through migration and settlement patterns. We use the empirical evidence from a number of western nations to identify the role of conventional and specialised public transport as an alternative to the automobile in meeting mobility and accessibility needs.},

Here, we present survey results indicating that such lateadulthood differences in preferences are supported by age-related shifts corresponding to differences in housing preferences expressed by individuals in peripheral as well as central locations in Sweden. A sample of , individuals aged  years and over was asked to select the seven most important characteristics of a dwelling from a list of  alternatives (Survey of Housing Intentions among the ELDerly in Sweden (SHIELD), ). The preferences expressed were used as dependent variables in logistic regressions to determine to what extent the housing preferences of older people are linked to age, gender, socio-economic status and type of geographical area. The results demonstrated a close link between neighbourhood characteristics and housing preferences. Owning the dwelling, having a garden and access to nature were stressed as important by individuals living in non-metropolitan middle-class areas and in suburban elite areas. The youngest cohort expressed similar preferences. Older age groups instead stressed the importance of an elevator, single-storey housing and a good design for independent living; preferences that have similarities to those expressed by individuals living in large cities and smaller urban centres where such housing is more readily available.},

The estimates are derived from a choice experiment funded by the Utah Department of Transportation and Utah Transit Authority---an experiment based upon large samples of both homeowners and renters who participated in a larger, statewide transportation study. The choice experiment and transportation study allow us to control for a rich set of household-level demographic and lifestyle characteristics, which in turn permits identification of a host of factors contributing to heterogeneity in residential preferences. We leverage a percentage-change housing cost attribute included in the experiment to obtain measures of marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for the various residential attributes and attribute levels in our study. Our method of converting the percentage-change cost attribute to dollar-denominated MWTP results in theoretically plausible estimates of a household's MWTP. We find that preferences for residential amenities differ across homeowners and renters with respect to intensity rather than direction---homeowners are generally willing to pay more for these amenities, in some cases up to seven times more. Our quantitative estimates of these preferences and the extent to which we control for heterogeneity across households provide urban and regional planners with precise monetary welfare measures for a sizable majority of the region's residents.},

The aim of this study was to examine the association between access to green space and mental health among adult twin pairs. Methods We used a multilevel random intercept model of same-sex twin pairs (4338 individuals) from the community-based University of Washington Twin Registry to analyse the association between access to green space, as measured by the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and self-reported depression, stress, and anxiety. The main parameter of interest was the within-pair effect for identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins because it was not subject to confounding by genetic or shared childhood environment factors. Models were adjusted for income, physical activity, neighbourhood deprivation and population density. Results When treating twins as individuals and not as members of a twin pair, green space was significantly inversely associated with each mental health outcome. The association with depression remained significant in the within-pair MZ univariate and adjusted models; however, there was no within-pair MZ effect for stress or anxiety among the models adjusted for income and physical activity. Conclusions These results suggest that greater access to green space is associated with less depression, but provide less evidence for effects on stress or anxiety. Understanding the mechanisms linking neighbourhood characteristics to mental health has important public health implications. Future studies should combine twin designs and longitudinal data to strengthen causal inference.},

For the purpose of developing healthy urban neighbourhoods, this raises the question how to take scientific evidence about these health benefits into account. Accessibility metrics that are well substantiated by empirical evidence are needed. This paper reviews the quantitative and qualitative aspects relevant for accessibility metrics and empirical studies addressing these aspects in relation to health. Studies comparing different types of green space indicators suggest that cumulative opportunities indicators are more consistently positively related to health than residential proximity ones. In contrast to residential proximity indicators, cumulative opportunities indicators take all the green space within a certain distance into account. Comparing results across studies proved to be hard. Green space accessibility was measured in a variety of ways and the green space indicator that was chosen was often not problematized. We feel that it is time for a more function-oriented approach. How precisely does contact with nature impact health and what type and qualities are relevant in this regard? We think this will lead to a new generation of more evidence-based accessibility metrics that will help to advance the field.},

  author = {Hildebrand, Eric D},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {The current lack of a detailed description of elderly travel characteristics and behaviours, particularly one that examines the issue at a level involving activity engagement, was a deficiency addressed by this research. Using data from the 1994/95 Portland, Oregon, Household Activity and Stated Preference Survey a simplified activity-based travel model for the elderly was developed and validated. The modelling framework makes use of lifestyle groups which are delineated through advance analyses. The final cluster solution chosen to provide a categorical basis for the modelling framework identified six distinct lifestyle groups based on sociodemographic variables. The clusters were subjectively labelled Workers, Mobile Widows, Granny Flats, Mobility Impaired, Affluent Males, and Disabled Drivers. The clusters were found to have statistically significant differences in travel behaviour and activity engagement patterns. These findings are useful to policy-makers who attempt to balance the mobility needs of the elderly with the prospect for stricter driving license policies in response to traffic safety concerns. The model framework successfully replicated all facets of the base data set used for its development. Using a sequential process, the micro-simulation model employs a bottom-up approach by stochastically developing daily activity itineraries for individuals which are subsequently assembled into trip tours. Elements of travel behaviour synthesized for individuals being modelled included total daily activities (with and without travel), activities engaged in by class (with and without travel), total daily trip tours, and mode splits. The research has shown that a categorical approach using lifestyle groups with unique activity and travel characteristics can be successfully combined within an activity-based framework. Although this approach was applied specifically to the elderly, it can be extended to other heterogeneous groups including the population as a whole. Furthermore, the study has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the varied lifestyles, activity patterns, and subsequent travel behaviour and needs of the elderly.},

Two commonly used elicitation methods for this purpose are discrete choice experiments (DCE) and case 2 best-worst scaling (BWS). These methods differ in terms of their cognitive burden, which is especially relevant when eliciting preferences among older people. Using a randomised experiment with respondents from an online panel, this paper examines the cognitive burden associated with colour-coded and level overlapped DCE, colour-coded BWS, and `standard' BWS choice tasks in a complex health state valuation setting. Our sample included 469 individuals aged 65 and above. Based on both revealed and stated cognitive burden, we found that the DCE tasks were less cognitively burdensome than case 2 BWS. Colour coding case 2 BWS cannot be recommended as its effect on cognitive burden was less clear and the colour coding lead to undesired choice heuristics. Our results have implications for future health state valuations of complex quality of life instruments and at least serve as an example of assessing cognitive burden associated with different types of choice experiments.},

Caregiving can have a profound impact on the health and wellbeing of carers. Ignoring these spillovers in economic evaluations risks labelling interventions mistakenly as cost-effective, at the expense of informal caregivers. Objective{\enspace} This paper investigates willingness-to-accept (WTA) values for an hour of informal care, corrected for positive and negative impacts of informal care, to facilitate the inclusion of informal care hours on the cost side of economic evaluations without double-counting spillover effects. Methods{\enspace} A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands (n\,=\,552) in September 2011. An experimental design minimizing the D-error was used to construct choice sets with two unlabelled alternatives with the attributes `hours caregiving', `monetary compensation for caregiving' and seven impacts of caregiving. To operationalize the random utility model, we used a panel mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) parameter model. For calculation of WTA, we used both population-level parameters and individual-level parameters. Results{\enspace} The mean WTA for an additional hour of informal care, corrected for positive and negative impacts of informal care, was {\texteuro}14.57. The signs of the coefficients were all in the expected directions. Conclusions{\enspace} This study reports a preference-based monetary value for informal care, corrected for other impacts. This valuation facilitates the inclusion of informal care hours on the cost side in economic evaluations without double-counting any spillover effects included on the effects side.},

However, understanding this is highly relevant for policymakers to understand the impacts of their transport decisions. These dimensions include the distribution of mobility and accessibility levels over particular areas or for specific population groups, as well as how this may affect various social outcomes, including their levels of participation, social inclusion and community cohesion. In response, we propose a method to assess the socially relevant accessibility impacts (SRAIs) of policies in some of these key dimensions. The method combines the use of underlying ethics principles, more specifically the theories of egalitarianism and sufficientarianism, in combination with accessibility-based analysis and the Lorenz curve and Gini index. We then demonstrate the method in a case study example. Our suggestion is that policymakers can use these ethical perspectives to determine the equity of their policies decisions and to set minimum standards for local transport delivery. This will help them to become more confident in the development and adoption of new decision frameworks that promote accessibility over mobility and which also disaggregate the costs and benefits of transport policies over particular areas or for specific under-served population groups.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Understanding the preferences of patients and health professionals is useful for health policy and planning. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a quantitative technique for eliciting preferences that can be used in the absence of revealed preference data. The method involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios, goods or services. Each alternative is described by several attributes and the responses are used to determine whether preferences are significantly influenced by the attributes and also their relative importance. DCEs are widely used in high-income contexts and are increasingly being applied in low- and middle-income countries to consider a range of policy concerns. This paper aims to provide an introduction to DCEs for policy-makers and researchers with little knowledge of the technique. We outline the stages involved in undertaking a DCE, with an emphasis on the design considerations applicable in a low-income setting.},

The statistical results indicate that access to a garden or short distances to green areas from the dwelling are associated with less stress and a lower likelihood of obesity. The number of visits cannot explain the effects of green areas on the health indicators. It is suggested that the significance of distance to green areas is mainly derived from its correlation with the character of the neighbourhood and its conduciveness to outdoor activities and ``healthy'' modes of travel.},

This methodological approach is novel to the literature. We derive the willingness-to-pay for different residential attributes and show how these attributes can be traded off against each other to create best living concepts. We discuss how these living concepts can be translated into customized architectural design while making use of standard architectural elements.},

This paper provides insights on whether loss aversion, in relation to the locational attributes of housing alternatives, affects the preference for alternative housing choices of older people. We propose an extended framework to measure symmetric as well as asymmetric valuation of losses and gains by an individual. The framework is applied in a discrete choice model based on a stated choice experiment with 440 Dutch home owners in the age group of 65 - 75\,years. We find clearly that the current living situation (reference) affects the housing choice behaviour. Among other things, we find a general aversion to changing the type of location for almost all possible moves between city, suburban and town. The results have clear implications for ageing-in-place policies which are currently being developed in many countries.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the associations between the accessibility, greenness, size, and type (active vs. passive) of public open spaces (POS) and clinical risk markers for cardiometabolic diseases and whether such associations could be explained (mediated) by physical activity and psychological well-being. Adult participants (n = 3754) provided clinical, self-reported, and residential location data. Cardiometabolic risk was defined as the sum of six anthropometric and biochemical risk markers. POS accessibility was defined as the number and proportion of POS within a 1000-m road distance from participants' residences. Greenness, size and type were respectively defined as the median Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, median size, and proportion of POS with a sporting land use for all accessible POS. Physical activity and psychological well-being were self-reported. Associations were tested using Poisson regression models accounting for spatial clustering of observations and participants' age, gender, education, income and area-level socioeconomic disadvantage. The number and proportion of POS were not found to be statistically significantly related to cardiometabolic health; however, greenness, size, and type (active) of available POS were inversely related to cardiometabolic risk. The association between POS and cardiometabolic health was partially mediated by physical activity. Psychological well-being was not implicated in the associations tested. These results suggest that the characteristics, not the number or proportion, of locally accessible POS are related to cardiometabolic health and, to some degree, physical activity. Maintaining or improving the quality of locally available POS might be a more effective urban design strategy to support cardiometabolic health than efforts to increase the accessibility of POS.},

It also undertakes a city-wide equity analysis of Perth and compares this with a published analysis for Melbourne. Overall the public transport distribution of the three socially disadvantaged groups was identified to be less equitable when compared to the population as a whole. The elderly had the most inequitable distribution of population relative to other cohorts. Perth's population exhibits a 0.52 Gini coefficient suggesting a relatively unequal spatial distribution of services to the population. However, this is much better than Melbourne (at 0.68). Results imply that 70\% of Perth's population have only 33\% of services supplied, whilst in Melbourne this figure was 19\%. Policy implications and areas for future research in this field were identified.},

  author = {Schulz, Manuela and Gross, Christiane and Teti, Andrea},
  abstract = {Past research indicates that for older individuals, transitioning to a home environment better suited to their needs reduces physical, psychological, and social risks, and may even impact the rate of institutionalization. Tenants, compared to homeowners, are subject to different conditions that influence their decisions to relocate, which can either encourage or inhibit them in their pursuit of environmental proactivity. This study investigates whether tenants make relocation decisions based on different factors than do owners. For this purpose, hypothetical relocation decisions are made under the influence of certain ownership constellations. The dataset consists of 264 participants. They were asked about home ownership and then presented with housing vignettes (factorial survey) to indicate how likely they would be to move to a new apartment. The data were analyzed using group comparisons and zero-inflated models. Tenants favor new apartments if their current dwelling is larger than the new one, and if they haven't lived in their current home for a long time. In contrast, owners prefer the new apartment to have a central location. Both groups consider rent, proximity to kin, and a senior-friendly bathroom as important for the new apartment, with rent being more important to tenants than to those who are currently owners. In both groups, we identified predictors that can be interpreted as barriers to environmental proactivity. The results add to the large body of literature on social inequality in old age.},

  abstract = {Background: While housing and neighborhood features have the potential to impact opportunities for active aging, there is a lack of knowledge related to how older people reason regarding their housing situation and how housing and fulfillment of relocation are associated with active and healthy aging. Objective: The objectives of Prospective RELOC-AGE are to study housing choices and relocation and explore effects on active and healthy aging among men and women aged 55 years and older in Sweden considering relocation. Methods: The estimated sample (2800) will include people aged 55 years and older being listed for relocation at either of two housing companies: a local public housing company in Southern Sweden and a national condominium provider. Prospective RELOC-AGE has a 2-level longitudinal mixed methods design and includes quantitative surveys (implemented by a professional survey company) and a telephone interview for baseline data collection in 2021, with follow-ups with the same procedures in 2022 and 2023. The survey and interviews include questions related to present housing and neighborhood, relocation plans and expectations, a range of perspectives on active and healthy aging, and demographics. Linking to national registers will provide additional data on home help and health care use, objective housing, and neighborhood characteristics. To explore what housing attributes older adults considering relocation find important and to what extent when making their decisions on housing, we will develop a discrete choice experiment to be implemented with a subsample of participants. Further, a grounded theory approach will be applied to collect in-depth interview data from participants who have moved to another dwelling, within 6 months of the move. A follow-up interview 12 months later will focus on participants' deepened experience over time in terms of fulfilled expectations and relocation experiences. Results: As of submission of this protocol (June 2021), recruitment has commenced with approximately 960 respondents to the survey and ongoing telephone interviews. We anticipate recruitment and data collection based on surveys and interviews to continue during 2021. Conclusions: Prospective RELOC-AGE has the capacity to generate new policy-relevant knowledge on associations of housing, relocation, and active and healthy aging. Such knowledge is relevant for the development of proactive approaches to housing in old age on the individual, group, and societal levels.},
