## Welcome to the workshop!

::: {.incremental}

- Will take a look at Overleaf and how to use it.
- Hands on - you'll be able to understand and use Overleaf by today.
- Many "rabbit" holes to go down and get lost in.
- Let's not do that.  Instead, we'll focus is on making it work. For you. Today
- More of a crash course and hands on session!

# Qverlea... Latex!



- I thought we were talking about Overleaf, what's with the tomfoolery?!
- Overleaf is simply a online tool that let's you use Latex easily on the web.
- It takes some of the complications out of dealing with Latex, which is neat.
- So while the presentation is on Overleaf, ...we really mean Latex.

:::

## So why Latex?

::: {.incremental}

- You can have high quality, publication-ready documents with minimal effort.
- Yes, minimal effort.
- It does some things very well - such as complex tables, formulas, and formatting more complex documents.
- It allows you to make very polished documents - "The clothes make the (wo)man!"

:::

## Latex - who's it for?

::: {.incremental}

- More for complex or formatted documents - journal articles, theses, dissertations, books, etc.
- There is a learning curve but we now have tools - it has never been easier!

## From single file to folder

- Word: all the data is in a single file.
- Latex: all the data is in a folder
- When you compile the document it takes all the data and renders the document

## Let's get started!

- Sign up - it's free in its basic usage.


## Producing a sample document

- We'll start with a simple blank document

## Our first document {auto-animate="true"}

-   I see code - RUN! RUN! RUN!

``` latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\end{document}
```



## Some text {auto-animate="true"}

-   I see code - RUN! RUN! RUN!

``` latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```

## What did we just do?

``` latex{code-line-numbers="1|2|5|3-4|2,5"}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```
## Let's continue {auto-animate="true"}

## Our first section {auto-animate="true"}

-   Let's add some sections

``` latex{}
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.

\end{document}

```

## Some sections {auto-animate="true"}

-   Let's add some sections

``` latex{code-line-numbers="5|10"}
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\section{Introduction}

First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.

\section{Conclusion}

Here we conclude the document

\end{document}

```

## How to use in practice?

::: {.incremental}
  - In practice: start with a skeleton document and fill in as you go
  - Copy and paste your text into the template
  - Add your bibliography
  - Edit your references
  - Add tables/figures
  
::: 

## Hands on!

::: {.incremental}

- sign up if you haven't already at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
- find the "elsivier template"
- Add your name, association and a title
- render a pdf and download a copy!
:::

## Intergration into your workflow

::: {.incremental}
- Many programs let you export results directly in Latex format!
- Stata: outreg2, estout/esttab, tabout, dtable
- R: kableExtra, stargazer, texreg
- SPSS: no native support -> export and edit in Excel
- Set it up once and you'll never have to fuss with that descriptive table again.

## Copy and paste is your friend

``` 

## Reference managers

- Latex reads a ".bib" file to see what your references are
- All the reference managers have the ability to export a bib file
- Easily integrate all your refs into the document


## Resources

- Overleaf itself (Many tutorials available)
- Chatgpt (Seriously, it's so good)!
- Someone has had your question before, search for it!
- Tables: "Excel2latex" addin. - a life saver for tables
- Resource manager.

## Some comments

- Overleaf is a handy tool for creating those polished/professional looking documents.
- Simple document? Just use word...
- Many features you'll need to pay for in Overleaf
- After experimenting - consider running Latex on your own computer.
- Very similar to using Overleaf but you can use more tools (connect with Github for version control, automatic bibs/tables/figures, etc)
