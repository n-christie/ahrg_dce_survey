- Many "rabbit" holes to go down and get lost in.
- Let's not do that.  Instead, we'll focus is on making it work. For you. Today

# Qverlea... Latex!



- I thought we were talking about Overleaf, what's with the tomfoolery?!
- Overleaf is simply a online tool that let's you use Latex easily on the web.
- It takes some of the complications out of dealing with Latex, which is neat.
- So while the presentation is on Overleaf, ...we really mean Latex.

:::

## So why Latex?

::: {.incremental}

- You can have high quality, publication-ready documents with minimal effort.
- Yes, minimal effort.
- It does some things very well - such as complex tables, formulas, and formatting more complex documents.
- It allows you to make very polished documents - "The clothes make the woman!"

:::

## Latex - who's it for?

::: {.incremental}

- More for complex or formatted documents - journal articles, theses, dissertations, books, etc.
- There is a learning curve but we now have tools - it has never been easier!

## Latex and Overleaf

- History and background of Latex
- Overleaf

## From single file to folder

- Word: all the data is in a single file.
- Latex: all the data is in a folder
- When you compile the document it takes all the data and renders the document

## Let's get started!

- Sign up - it's free in its basic usage.


## Producing a sample document

- We'll start with a simple blank document

## Our first document {auto-animate="true"}

-   I see code - RUN! RUN! RUN!

``` latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\end{document}
```



## Some text {auto-animate="true"}

-   I see code - RUN! RUN! RUN!

``` latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```

## What did we just do?

``` latex{code-line-numbers="1|2|5|3-4|2,5"}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.
\end{document}
```
## Let's continue {auto-animate="true"}

## Our first section {auto-animate="true"}

-   Let's add some sections

``` latex{}
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

First document. This is a simple example, with no 
extra parameters or packages included.

\end{document}

```

## Hands on

- In practice: start with a skeleton document and fill in as you go
  - Copy and paste your text into the template
  - Add your bibliography
  - Edit your references
  - Add tables
  

## Resources

- Overleaf itself (Many tutorials available)
- Chatgpt (Seriously, it's so good)!
- Someone has had your question before, search for it!
- Tables: "Excel2latex" addin. - a life saver for tables
- Resource manager.
