# Today's agenda {.smaller}

We'll take a look at our latest progress implementing a discrete choice experiment while covering a couple of related topics:


::: incremental
-   Update on the project
-   Learn about Discrete Choice Experiments - that's a mouthful, let's call them DCEs
-   A quick background on DCEs
-   Attributes and levels – the assumptions and traps we’re trying to avoid.
-   Revisit the survey from the researcher perspective
-   Take an updated survey
-   Discussion and feedback

# RELOC-AGE 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', fig.height=2}
library(DiagrammeR)
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]


a   [label = 'Baseline\nSpring 2021\nn=1964'] 
b [label = 'Follow-up\nSpring 2022\nn=1254'] 
c  [label = '2nd follow-up\nSpring 2024\nn=???', color = red, fontcolor = red] 


a -> b -> c
}")
```

Exact sample sizes depend on variations in missing data

## Development of the research aim

::: incremental
- We know many physical housing attributes that respondents find important (balcony, elevator, single floor, etc.)
- We know little about the preferred attributes dealing with ___location___.
- Where do people want to be situated?
- Does proximtiy to certain services or location matter?
- If so, which are most important?
:::


## Aim and RQ's

::: incremental
- "The overall aim is to explore the factors which matters most for the choice of another dwelling among people aged 55 years or more, interested in relocation.”
- "The overarching aim of this paper is to explore heterogeneous locational preferences of those aged 55 years or more and interested in relocation"

# Discrete Choice Experiments

-   A DCE is a research method used in various fields, including economics, marketing, and healthcare, to understand individuals' preferences and decision-making processes.

-   The primary goal of a DCE is to elicit and quantify individuals' preferences for different attributes or features of a product, service, or policy by presenting them with a series of choice scenarios.

::: notes
Key word here is "elicit"
:::

## Choice experiments

-   DCE's fall into the more broader group of choice experiments.
-   When we make a choice, we show a **preference**.
-   Preferences can be construed as **stated** or **revealed**.

## Stated vs. revealed preferences

-   Stated: Researchers gather information by directly asking individuals about their preferences, opinions, or choices through interviews, surveys, or other data collection methods.

-   Revealed: Researchers analyze real-world data, such as consumer purchasing behavior, travel patterns, or **observed choices**, to uncover implicit preferences.

## Revealed preferences - advantages

-   Advantages: Revealed preferences offer a more accurate reflection of individuals' preferences as they are derived from observable actions, reducing biases associated with self-reporting.

## Discrete Choice Experiments

-   DCE's are a type of revealed preference experiments.
-   By asking (forcing) respondents to choose between alternatives in a controlled experiment we can elicit preferences from the sample.

## Attributes and levels

- Attributes
  - Are the attributes well-defined?
- Levels
  - Distance in km or time walking?
  - Apartments in Sweden - make sense 15km away from shops?
