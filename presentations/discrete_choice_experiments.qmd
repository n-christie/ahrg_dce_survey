# Today's agenda {.smaller}

We'll take a look at our latest progress implementing a discrete choice experiment while covering a couple of related topics:


::: incremental
-   Update on the project
-   Learn about Discrete Choice Experiments - that's a mouthful, let's call them DCEs
-   Attributes and levels – the assumptions and traps we’re trying to avoid.
-   Revisit the survey from the researcher perspective
-   Take an updated survey
-   Discussion and feedback

# RELOC-AGE 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(DiagrammeR)
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]


a   [label = 'Baseline\nSpring 2021\nn=1964'] 
b [label = 'Follow-up\nSpring 2022\nn=1254'] 
c  [label = '2nd follow-up\nSpring 2024\nn=???', color = red, fontcolor = red] 


a -> b -> c
}")
```

Exact sample sizes depend on variations in missing data

## Sample description 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Location 

```{r map, eval=TRUE ,warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, widget.layout.height = "calc(100vh - 90px)"}
library(leaflet)
library(kableExtra)
address_lat_lon <- readRDS("discrete_choice_experiments_files/coords.rds") 

leaflet(address_lat_lon,width = "100%" ) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(~lon,
             ~lat,
             popup="Respondents",
             #clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
             ) 

```

## Housing attributes {.scrollable}

## Development of the research aim

::: incremental
- We know many physical housing attributes that respondents find important (balcony, elevator, single floor, etc.)
- We know little about the preferred attributes dealing with ___location___.
- Where do people want to be situated?
- Does proximtiy to certain services or location matter?
- If so, which locational attributes are most important?
:::


## Aim and RQ's

Potential candidates...

::: incremental
- "The overall aim is to explore the factors which matters most for the choice of another dwelling among people aged 55 years or more, interested in relocation.”
- "The overarching aim of this paper is to explore heterogeneous locational preferences of those aged 55 years or more and interested in relocation"

# Discrete Choice Experiments

-   A DCE is a research method used in various fields, including economics, marketing, and healthcare, to understand individuals' preferences and decision-making processes.
-   The primary goal of a DCE is to elicit and quantify individuals' preferences for different attributes or features of a product, service, or policy by presenting them with a series of choice scenarios.

::: notes
Key word here is "elicit"
:::

## Choice experiments

-   DCE's fall into the more broader group of choice experiments.
-   When we make a choice, we show a **preference**.
-   Preferences can be construed as **stated** or **revealed**.

## Stated vs. revealed preferences

-   Stated: Researchers gather information by directly asking individuals about their preferences, opinions, or choices through interviews, surveys, or other data collection methods.
-   Revealed: Researchers analyze real-world data, such as consumer purchasing behavior, travel patterns, or **observed choices**, to uncover implicit preferences.

## Revealed preferences - advantages

-   Advantages: Revealed preferences offer a more accurate reflection of individuals' preferences as they are derived from observable actions, reducing biases associated with self-reporting.

## Discrete Choice Experiments

-   Discrete choice models operate within a framework of rational choice; that is, it is assumed that when confronted with a discrete set of options, people choose the option of maximal benefit or utility.
-   It follows that the choice is a function of the utility found in each attributes found in options presented.
-   By asking (forcing) many respondents to choose between alternatives in a controlled experiment we can elicit preferences from the population.
-   We can then perform statistical inference about the functional parameters. 

## Examples

- Marketing 
- Transportation

## Process in a nutshell


```{r , echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("digraph flowchart {
      # node definitions with substituted label text
      node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = rectangle]        
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']
      tab3 [label = '@@3']
      tab4 [label = '@@4']
      tab5 [label = '@@5']

      # edge definitions with the node IDs
      tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3 -> tab4 -> tab5;
      }

      [1]: 'Select attributes and their levels'
      [2]: 'Survey design - creates optimal mix/number of choice sets'
      [3]: 'Administer survey - using choice sets from the design'
      [4]: 'Analyze the data - estimate models'
      [5]: 'Present/interpret the results - tables/figures on coeffcient sizes'
      ")
```

## Attributes - Properties{.smaller}

Below are some attribute property guidelines taken from the literature. 

The greater number of attributes, the greater the cognitive difficulty of completing a DCE. [@manghamHowNotDesigning2009]

* Increased age would tend to exacerbate the cognitive burden of the DCE, highlighting the need to address the complexity of the experiment in order to obtain valid and reliable responses [@himmlerWhatWorksBetter2021]

* There should be no more than 10 to ensure respondents are able to consider all attributes listed [@himmlerWhatWorksBetter2021]

* Definitions of the attributes should not be ambiguous and should be __easily interpretable__ by the respondents. [@deshazoDesigningChoiceSets2002]

* the attributes presented should be viable options for all respondents ( Or at least for  __most__ ).

* The experiments pivots around utility theory.  __All attributes and levels should have a positive utility__.

## Attributes and levels

-   _Distance to green areas_ - 5km, 10km,15km
-   _Distance to services_ - 5km, 10km,15km
-   _Distance to transportation_ - 5km, 10km,15km
-   _Parking_ -
-   _Cost_ - -20%, -10%, Same, 10%, 20%
