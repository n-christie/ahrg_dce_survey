We find that, following the adoption of these laws, capital expenditures as a percentage of book assets decrease, resulting in slower sales growth. Our findings are consistent with theories predicting that greater employment protection discourages investment by making projects more irreversible. Supporting this channel, following negative cash flow shocks, firms are less likely to downsize operations in states that have adopted these laws but more likely to downsize in states that have not adopted these laws.             Authors have furnished code, data, and an Internet Appendix, which are available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.},

Our results show that investment is significantly affected by the presence of both market imperfections; they are robust to alternative measures of EPL. Moreover, the effect of labor market regulation is weaker wherever financial market imperfections are smaller: firms with better access to financial markets are in a position to determine their optimal investment policy, even in the presence of stringent employment protection laws, than those facing financial constraints. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The literature has hypothesized that adjustment costs, particularly labor adjustment costs, play a significant and central role in driving empirically observed cost behavior patterns. Recent studies attempt to empirically test this hypothesis, albeit with distinct limitations. Using a new proxy for labor adjustment costs in a different population of firms, our study takes a fresh look at this hypothesis. We test the robustness of results documented in prior studies to help substantiate the credibility, reliability, and stability of prior findings.},

We use firm-level data for 1,106 Korean manufacturing firms over the period 1982 to 2015. The results are as follows. First, group firms are much larger than independent firms, and investment rates are higher in group firms than in independent firms. Second, Tobin's q is a significant determinant of investment, and the adjustment costs of investment are smaller in group firms than in independent firms. Third, the adjustment-cost advantage of group firms is greater before the financial crisis of 1997. Fourth, a firm's cash holdings and foreign ownership contribute to increasing investment. This study suggests that group firms invest more than independent firms due to lower adjustment costs, and consequently contribute to economic growth through investment expansion.},

A dollar of current- and prior-year cash flow is associated with \$0.32 of additional investment for firms that are the least likely to be constrained and \$0.63 of additional investment for firms that are the most likely to be constrained, even after correcting for measurement error in q.

The result is corroborated in the supplementary analysis that exploits the cross-country and cross-industry variation of capital adjustment costs, as proxied by the level of technological advancement. More generally, our findings demonstrate that I-CF sensitivity should only be interpreted as a joint measure of financial and real frictions.},

I further find that a firm holds more cash when labor adjustment costs are larger, and such an effect concentrates on firms that do not engage in derivative hedging.},
